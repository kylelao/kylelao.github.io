            <p>My name is Kyle Lao, I am 17 years old, and I attend Pasadena High School. I like to play many                      sports, such as basketball, soccer, tennis, and skateboarding. My favorite class is AP Environmental                which is the study of interrelationships between human activities and the environment. I am                          interested into environmental problems both natural and human-made, to evaluate the                                  relative risks associated with these problems, and to examine alternative solutions for resolving                    and/or preventing them. I like to work in groups because there is collaboration and other ideas put                  together.
