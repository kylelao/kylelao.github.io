            <p>The assignment was to make a sonnet about your actual life and how it relates to yourself. Figuring out words to use for the sonnet was the hardest. How to Rhyme related words. This was fun because you can do anything to it to make it better and just change it.

            <p>The Struggle
                <br>
                <br>
I wake up each day that is on repeat<br>
These days I put my journey on shuffle<br>
In my heart their is a consistent beat<br>
I have all my problems in the duffle<br>
<br>
Hiding behind in shadows from others<br>
Can’t compete against the light that loosens<br>
I’m always slipping through life like butter<br>
Everyone in my class makes me stupid<br>
<br>
Realizing life is reality<br>
Changing it upside down and inside out<br>
Wants someone to keep straight with the referee<br>
Need to know what life is really about<br>
<br>
Soon I will know what's right with my blind eyes<br>
Only thing I see is beautiful skies<br>
<br>
